The name of my term project is LiveNotes.  LiveNotes is a text-editor with a unique set of features: typing, text-selecting, cut/copy/paste, font options, bulleted-lists, math symbols, drawing, highlighting, erasing, images, tables, recorded notes, an on-screen keyboard, a spelling tool and typo-finder, a dictionary, and file saving and opening.  This unique set of features makes LiveNotes a dynamic and refreshing text-editor -- a familiar yet new experience.

Run the file titled "LiveNotes.gyp" to use LiveNotes.  Other than installing external libraries (explained in the next paragraph), everything needed to fully run LiveNotes is already provided in its folder, not requiring setup.  There are two .pkl files already created and provided that LiveNotes uses in its language-based features (one is a set of all English words and the other is a dictionary of commonly used English words with values as their level of common use).  There is also a 112 graphics package included that is slightly modified to prevent the LiveNotes screen dimensions (height and width) from being modified.  There are also five images included: four that are used for the help screen's graphics, and one that is solely intended for testing users to upload onto LiveNotes to play with the image feature.  

External libraries that need to be installed include:'import requests' and 'from bs4 import BeautifulSoup' and 'import speech_recognition as sr' and 'from cmu_112_graphics import *' (112 graphics is already included in the LiveNotes folder though).  Internal libraries include: 'from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfilename' and 'import random' and 'import csv' and 'import urllib' and 'import pickle' and 'import string' (no need to install, as they are already part of Python and imported by LiveNotes).

LiveNotes does not use or need any shortcut commands because all of its features can be accessed equally at any time.  It is worth noting, however, that pressing the 'esc' key while using LiveNotes is a path back to the home screen.
