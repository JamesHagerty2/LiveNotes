(To successfully use LiveNotes, download everything from this project and place all of it in the same folder.)

WARNINGS: You cannot upload images to LiveNotes that are not in the same folder with every file comprising LiveNotes.  You also cannot open csv files that do not belong to the same folder (LiveNotes writes csv files saving what you created in LiveNotes that you can reopen in LiveNotes).

LiveNotes is a text-editor with a unique set of features: typing, text-selecting, cut, copy, paste, font options, bulleted-lists, math symbols, drawing, highlighting, erasing, images, tables, recorded notes, an on-screen keyboard, a spelling tool, a typo-finder, a dictionary, and file writing and reading.  
 
Other than external libraries (mentioned in the following paragraph), everything needed to run LiveNotes is already provided in these files, not requiring setup on your part.  There are two .pkl files already created and provided that LiveNotes uses.  There is also a 112 graphics package included that is slightly modified to prevent the LiveNotes screen dimensions (height and width) from being modified.  There are also five images included: four that are used for the help screen's graphics, and one that is solely intended for testing users to upload onto LiveNotes to play with the image feature.  

Imports requiring you to install external libraries include:'import requests' and 'from bs4 import BeautifulSoup' and 'import speech_recognition as sr'.

Run the file titled "LiveNotes.gyp" to use LiveNotes.

Notable shorcut: Press 'esc' to return to the home screen where you have access to both the tex-editor and the help page.
